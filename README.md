# FoodRanger-Backend
FoodRanger (imaginary) is a local food delivery platform. They partner up with local restaurants and deliver food to the customerâ€™s doorstep. Upon landing on their website, a user can search for restaurants by name or pre-defined area. Based on his search he will be shown a list of matching restaurants.

Based on the requirements for developing the FoodRanger app I have created REST APIs.
I am using Node.js as the server language and MongoDB as the database.
